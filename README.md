# StockSight

StockSight is a small full-stack project that shows stock prices, technical indicators, and simple trading signals.  
It has:

* a **C++ backend API** (TimescaleDB + libpqxx + httplib)
* a **React frontend** (Vite)

The backend provides:

* `/api/prices`
* `/api/indicators`
* `/api/health`

The frontend displays charts and interacts with those endpoints.
